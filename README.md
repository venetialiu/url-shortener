# URL Shortener

This is a fullstack URL shortening project built with React.js and Node.js.

## Description

URL Shortener is a web application that allows users to create short and easy-to-share URLs from long and complex ones. It uses:
- **React.js** for the frontend
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsive layout
- **Node.js (Express)** for the backend
- **MongoDB** for storing URL mappings
